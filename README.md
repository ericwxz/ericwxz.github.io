## Some samples of my work!

I'm a senior at Yale University studying computer science. The rest of my courseload has been dedicated mostly to music and economics, and I manage the Davenport Pops Orchestra chamber group program on the side. 


Current GPA (as of 9/2021): 3.77

Expected graduation: May 2022


### Graphics
The final project in Computer Graphics, taught by Professor Ted Kim, involved building a raytracing engine in C++ that implemented a number of distributed effects. Our submission included both the code and a ten-second animation that displayed those effects. I ended up implementing glossy reflections and motion blur, among others.

### Computational Intelligence for Games
The final project in Computational Intelligence for Games, taught by Professor James Glenn, centered around using one of the techniques we had learned to develop and train an agent for a game of our choice. As a fan of Coup, I modeled a highly-simplified version of the game such that a method requiring perfect information might still be able to have some moderate success. I experimented a bit with deep q networks before shifting to implementing regular q-learning in the face of some tight deadlines.

  - running tester.py should display the results from the trained agent, or just use the makefile

### YHack 2020
We built an app aimed centering around navigating day-to-day life through Covid-- namely, around the issue of "space." Things like, how many people can I fit into my living room while keeping people six feet apart? How far away really is six feet when I'm standing on the street, or sitting at a restaurant? I took care of the camera component, addressing the second question. This was our first experience with building an Android app, and we won a surprising number of awards for it!
